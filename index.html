        <h2>UX vs UI</h2>
        <h6>Aug 24, 2016</h6>
					<h3>Difference Between UX and UI</h3>
					<p>
						UX stands for User Experience. This is how the user or person is <b>enjoying</b> your content/product. This usually is how the user is taking in the UI of your product and how they appeal to it. A good UX means a good UI!
					</p>
					<p>
						UI stands for User Interface. This is how your product <b>looks</b> like visually to the user. Usually, you would want your product to be <i>appealing</i> to the user so the UI would have to look neat and clean.
					</p>

        <h2>HTML &amp; CSS</h2>
        <h6>Aug 31, 2016</h6>
					<h3>What I thought of HTML &amp; CSS</h3>
					<p>
						I think CSS is a cool way of organizing your work and to make your coding look more clean. You can have a seperate tab of all of the background color, font size, font color, etc seperated from the main structure of your code.

        <h2>Digimon Go</h2>
        <h6>Oct 7, 2016</h6>
					<h3>What I thought about Digimon Go</h3>
					<p>
						The Digimon Go Activity was a bit challenging for me at first, since I did not know how to do the middle part of the blog. In this assignment I learned how to use borders, divs and other stuff more properly.

        <h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>
        <h6>Oct 7, 2016</h6>
					<h3>What I think about Responsive Web Design</h3>
					<p>
						During this time of learning about RWD, I found out there is more to just web design since you have to be aware of multiple platforms too. I also learned about the % value since it will automatically adjust to the size of your browser.

        <h2>Media Queries</h2>
        <h6>Aug 31, 2016</h6>
					<h3>What I thought about Media Queries</h3>
					<p>
						Media Queries are a cool way of having your website responsive to other devices looking at it. A Media Query can be adjusted in px and you could have your whole website in different colors, sizes or any of that sort adjusted to your leisure.

        <h2>Basic Javascript</h2>
        <h6>Nov 2, 2016</h6>
					<h3>What I learned and think about Javascript</h3>
					<p>
						Javascript is a pretty cool and completely different language than the HTML coding we did. It consists of variables, functions and defining them to make it work. Its like simple math that you have to do so far.

        <h2>Conditionals (Aliens)</h2>
        <h6>Nov 2, 2016</h6>
					<h3>What I thought about the Aliens Project</h3>
					<p>
						The Aliens project was pretty fun to do with my partner. We had to use Javascript to complete the project and cooperate with each other to determine how to start it off.

        <h2>Verizon App Challenge Review</h2>
        <h6>Nov 28, 2016</h6>
					<h3>Review Questions</h3>
					<p>
						Summarize Problem -
						Communication is a big part amongst people because as of this generation, students tend to not tell each other things.
						This causes confusion amongst a group of people such as school clubs, as some are not as organized as other clubs.

						Summarize how app solves it
						How our app solves it is that it improves the communication amongst groups (clubs) which reduces the confusion that people have. Also it helps groups be more organized with our remind feature that we plan to have.

						How would you improve your video
						A few ways we could improve our video is to improve our audio and make our acting seem more natural

						What are your current features
						Our current features are the remind feature which sends out a notification to members such as scheduled meetings. We also have a lunch menu. Another one we have is the feed back feature to teachers. Finally we have a group chat feature.
						
						What features would you like to add
						As of this moment, I'm not sure what I would like to add, I would have to discuss it amongst my group to see if they agree.

						Share challenges your team faced
						Some of the challenges our team faced is how our group could make our app better than other apps. At the moment we are still facing this problem.

						What would you do differently next time
						Perhaps I would think of an idea that no one else did, or did the research beforehand of what similar apps do NOT have.

        <h2>Its been a bumpy road</h2>
        <h6>Dec 19, 2016</h6>
					<h3>My Semester so far...</h3>
					<p>
						My whole semester so far has been a slightly bumpy but very fun! Coding class has been a fun course for me just like I expected. We learned basic HTML and CSS in the first quarter and Javascript on the next. Looking back, I realized how much I actually learned from this class.
